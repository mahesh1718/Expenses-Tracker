Hi, I'm Mahesh, pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science at Parul University. I have come up with a Python project called "Expensive Tracker," which tracks a person's expenses and provides a tabular format of the details.

Expensive Tracker
This is a Python project called "Expensive Tracker." The purpose of this program is to help you track and manage your expenses. It allows you to record different types of expenses, such as medical, rental, and school fees, and keep track of your remaining budget.

Features
Track Expenses: You can enter different types of expenses and record the amount spent.
Budget Management: You can set a budget, and the program will calculate the remaining balance after each expense.
CSV Output: The expenses are saved in a CSV file for easy viewing and analysis.
Reaction-based Feedback: The program gives you reactions and messages based on the expense type (e.g., happy for school fees, sad for medical).
-----------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:
1.Run the program.
2.Enter your budget for the month.
3.Start recording your expenses by typing the type of expense and the amount spent.
4.The program will calculate the remaining budget and save the details in a CSV file.
4.You can view the saved expenses by typing "done" when prompted.

->Requirements:
Python 3.x
reactions library (used for reactions and emoji feedback which was coded by me for my use)
tabulate library (used to display data in a table format)
